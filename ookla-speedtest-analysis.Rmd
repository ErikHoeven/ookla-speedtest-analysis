Introduction
------------
In this document we have conducted a statistical analysis of Ookla Speedtest data. The time period we consider is Q4 2014 so the months October, November and December of 2014. We perform an analysis of [Ookla](http://www.ookla.com/) speedtest data on three different measures: download speed, upload speed and latency(or ping). On these metrics we compare the three major providers of 4G mobile networks in the Netherlands, Vodafone, KPN and T-Mobile.

T-Mobile has asked DIKW Consulting to perform this test as an independent third party. DIKW Consulting was payed to perform this test by T-mobile and has no other intentions then to perform this test by it's own high quality standards. The analysis was performed by generally accepted and approved standards and statistical methods using open source tools.

We let the data speak for itself.

If you have questions you can contact [DIKW Consulting](http://www.dikw.nl). If you want to repeat this test by yourself you are welcome to do so, all necessary scripts are available on GitHub. The data is commercially available at [Ookla](http://www.ookla.com/).

This analysis, method, tools and scripts are open sourced and placed on GitHub, see the readme on the github [repository](https://github.com/hugokoopmans/ookla-speedtest-analysis).

Data
======
For this analysis we use a postgres database that is locally installed.

The data is loaded from three different files, each file resembling a mobile platform(Andriod,iPhone and Windows mobile). The data is loaded asis as it was recieved from the Ookla server. Scripts to load this data directly into postgresql db can be found in the gitbub repository.

All scripts to process the data are in SQL(available on github) or R(included in this document, thanks to [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/))

```{r options , echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}

# set global chunk options 
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=TRUE)

# load functions
source("statistical-analysis.R")

```


Let's get the data and do some basic counts.

```{r get-raw-data}

# postgreSQL
require("RPostgreSQL", lib.loc="~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.0")

# Establish connection to PoststgreSQL using RPostgreSQL
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")

# read data from 4Gdb
# Full version of connection setting
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname="4Gdb",host="localhost",port=5432,user="4Guser",password="4Gpassword" )

# all data joined
df.ad <- dbReadTable(con, c("ookla_all_data"))

# disconnect
dbDisconnect(con)
```

The raw data
---------------
From the raw files downloaded from the Ookla server per device type we load these into individual tables. 
In the table below we count the number of speedtests per device type.

```{r raw-table}
library(knitr)
tbl <- addmargins(table(df.ad$os))
#kable(as.data.frame(cbind(tbl,100*prop.table(tbl))),col.names = c('count','percentage'), digits = 2,caption="Raw test data counts")

kable(as.data.frame(tbl),col.names = c('','Counts'), caption="Raw test data counts")

```

So we start this analysis with `r nrow(df.ad)` rows in the raw dataset reccieved from Ookla.

Data Analyses
---------------
To understand the data better we do some analysis and we look at suspicious artifacts that could influence results. Typically we will look for device-id's that are used too often. Locations(specific latitude-longitude coordinates) that occur too often. We will look at the timeseries to see if there is a peak or pattern. We check if there are measurements that exceed the theoretical maximum speeds for the technology used.

After all these checks we end up with a dataset that is cleaned and ready to perform a statistical significance test.

### Suspicious devices
Are there any devices that perform tests very frequently? 

Let's look at a frequency plot of devices that occure more then *ten* times in each month. So on the right hand side we see devices that are used very often, some of them even on an hourly basis. obviously those devices are not in the hands of real customers so these will be removed from the dataset.

```{r freq-plot-devices}
library(ggplot2)

# months
df.ad.oct <- df.ad[as.Date(df.ad$test_date) >= as.Date('2014-10-01') & as.Date(df.ad$test_date) < as.Date('2014-11-01'),]
df.ad.nov <- df.ad[as.Date(df.ad$test_date) >= as.Date('2014-11-01') & as.Date(df.ad$test_date) < as.Date('2014-12-01'),]
df.ad.dec <- df.ad[as.Date(df.ad$test_date) >= as.Date('2014-12-01') & as.Date(df.ad$test_date) < as.Date('2015-01-01'),]

# plot grid
par(mfrow=c(3,1),mar=c(1,1,1,1),mai=c(0.1,1,0.1,0.1)) 

tbl <- table(df.ad.oct$device_id)
tbl <- sort(tbl[tbl>10]) # only keep > 10
nms <- rep("",dim(tbl))
barplot(tbl, names.arg = nms,main="October",ylab="Number of tests",xlab="Unique devices")
tbl.oct <- tbl

tbl <- table(df.ad.nov$device_id)
tbl <- sort(tbl[tbl>10]) # only keep > 10
nms <- rep("",dim(tbl))
barplot(tbl, names.arg = nms,main="November",ylab="Number of tests",xlab="Unique devices")
tbl.nov <- tbl

tbl <- table(df.ad.dec$device_id)
tbl <- sort(tbl[tbl>10]) # only keep > 10
nms <- rep("",dim(tbl))
barplot(tbl, names.arg = nms,main="December",ylab="Number of tests",xlab="Unique devices")
tbl.dec <- tbl

# max number of test to call a device suspicious
max_susp_dev = 30
```

So we remove specific devices that test more then `r max_susp_dev` times a month. These devices are probably used by telecom proffesionals for testing purposes. A test on 4G cost up to 100MBytes per test out of the data bundle(depending on the exact speed of course!). So 30 or more tests per month are equivalent to 3GB of data just spend on tests are suspicious. The number 30 by itself is subjective, we could use 25 or 40 depending on what exact level of tests per device you would call suspicious.

Actually including these are not influencing the results significantly, but we want to use real customer data as much as possible, not affected by proffesionals testing their own (or others) network.

Cleaning up the data
-------------------
The SQL script to clean up the data maps duplicates or spelling issues for the telecom operator names, see for details the SQL scripts on github. Also we do some transformations on the raw connection codes so we can identify technology used properly.

```{r get-clean-data}
# read data from 4Gdb
# Establish connection to PoststgreSQL using RPostgreSQL
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
# Full version of connection setting
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname="4Gdb",host="localhost",port=5432,user="4Guser",password="4Gpassword" )

# all data joined and cleaned for suspicious devices in SQL
df.clnd <- dbReadTable(con, c("ookla_all_data_clean"))

# get data for tm coverage area only
df.4G <- dbReadTable(con, c("datatm4gcoverage"))

# disconnect
dbDisconnect(con)
```

So after removing `r sum(tbl.oct>=max_susp_dev)` devices in October, `r sum(tbl.nov>=max_susp_dev)` devices in November and`r sum(tbl.dec>=max_susp_dev)` devices in December, which in total conducted `r nrow(df.ad)-nrow(df.clnd)` speedtests, the data has `r nrow(df.clnd)` cases.

Let's do some more basic stats on this data.

Top three operators
-------------------
For this analysis we are only interested in the top three operators in the Netherlands. In the raw data at this point there are `r length(levels(as.factor(df.clnd$operator)))` different operators identified. 
```{r top-operators}
top10 <- head(sort(table(df.clnd$operator),decreasing = TRUE),n=10)
kable(as.data.frame(cbind(rownames(top10),top10),row.names = FALSE),col.names = c('Operator','Number of speedtests'),align=c("l","r"),caption="Most frequent operators")

# filter on top three operators only
ops <- c("T-Mobile NL","Vodafone NL","KPN NL")
df.clnd.t3 <- df.clnd[df.clnd$operator %in% ops,]

```

The top three operators together are good for `r sum(tail(sort(table(df.clnd$operator)),n=3))` tests conducted all over the Netherlands in the test period.

Filtering on the top3 operators leaves `r nrow(df.clnd.t3)` cases in the dataset.

Focus on 4G technology
----------------
In the Ookla data we a variable called 'connection_type', this variable can be transformed into the network technology. Below we give an overview of the network tecchnology types available in the dataset.

Ookla Connetiontype defines 4G as connection type 15 for Android. For iOS, connection type 12 is LTE, and for Windows connection type 11 is LTE.

Definition of 4G from the SQL script:

```sql
  Case  WHEN  CONNECTION_TYPE=0			THEN 'UNKNOWN'
  	WHEN	CONNECTION_TYPE in (1,2)		THEN 'WIFI/CELL'
  	WHEN	CONNECTION_TYPE in (3,4)		THEN '2G'
  	WHEN	CONNECTION_TYPE=15			THEN '4G'
  	WHEN	CONNECTION_TYPE between 5 and 17	THEN '3G'
  	ELSE	'UNKNOWN'
  END AS TECHNOLOGY
```

Type of technology used:
```{r tech}
library(knitr)
tbl <- table(df.clnd.t3$technology)
kable(as.data.frame(cbind(tbl,100*prop.table(tbl))),col.names = c('Number of cases','Percentage'), digits = 2, caption="Technology used in tests")
```

**In the remainder of this analysis we will focus on 4G technology.**

Filtering on 4G technology leaves `r tbl["4G"]` testcases in the dataset.

Operating systems
------------------
For the top 3 operators we can look at the type of operating system used on these devices:

```{r top3-table}
library(knitr)
tbl <- table(df.clnd.t3$os,df.clnd.t3$operator)
# kable(as.data.frame(cbind(tbl,100*prop.table(tbl))),col.names = c('Number of cases','Percentage'), digits = 2,caption="Raw test data counts")
kable(tbl)
```

Most of the tests were conducted on an Android os closely followed by iOS. Windows mobile devices have limited representation in the dataset. In this test we are not interested in testing the difference in performance per device or operating system.

Sample test data from Ookla
--------------------------
Ookla has some random sample data available, this data can be used to validate our method. To validate the testresult one would need the specific data of the Netherlands.

A sample set of files from Ookla of the data can be found [here](http://www.ookla.com/netmetrics).

Geographical area
------------------
For this test to be fair to all three operators we limit the comparison of the test to areas that all operators claim to have 4G coverages at the time of the measurements. The 4G network is constantly improved and extended, every month the area T-Mobile has 4G coverage is extended. This means that some areas only got 4G coverage during the time period of the test. 

### Mapping test coordiantes to city boundaries
To identify the exact area we will use for this analysis we use data from CBS, CBS is the Central Bureau for Statistics in the Netherlands. They provide [publicly available](http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/themas/dossiers/nederland-regionaal/publicaties/geografische-data/archief/2014/2013-wijk-en-buurtkaart-art.htm) data on cities in the Netherlands. Based on these geographical city boundaries we map each latitude, longitude coordinate onto a city.

From T-Mobile we recieved a list of cities that, at the time of testing,  have 4G coverage. From the data we can see that per city each provider has sufficient number of speedtests in the dataset for the tests to be representative. 

Online we can get an up to date overview of network coverage for all three operators(see [here](http://www.4gdekking.nl/) ).

This test is not about coverage but about speed of the network. 

T-Mobile has the least 4G coverage of the three and per end of 2014 has actual coverage in the following area:

```{r area }
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("./img/tmobile4gcoverage.png")
grid.raster(img)

```

In this area the following number of tests then remain in the dataset.
```{r}
tbl <- table(df.4G$operator)
kable(as.data.frame(cbind(tbl,100*prop.table(tbl))),col.names = c('count','percentage'), digits = 2,caption="Number of 4G speedtests in coverage area")

```

Areas that only had 4G coverage from November 2014 onwards are: Apeldoorn, Voorst, Dinkelland, Enschede, Losser, Oldenzaal. 
Areas that were hooked up in December are : Eijsden, Maastricht, Margraten, Bedum, Groningen, Haren, Hoogezand-sappemeer, Leek, Loppersum, Noordenveld, Slochteren, Ten Boer, Tynaarlo

All other cities in the area had 4G coverage on or before 1 Oktober 2014.

The dataset contains `r nrow(df.4G)` at this point.

### Suspicious speeds

In the data we check for up and download speeds that are technocally impossible.
*Download speeds* for 4G are limited to 150Mbps on the T-mobile technology.

KPN and Vodafone have a technology called LT advanced which have a max of 225Mbps.

Any speedtest data that has speeds above this technical maximum are removed from the dataset.
 
```{r susp-down-speed}
# count number of cases that exceed theoretical max speed
n.max.tm <- nrow(subset(df.4G, download_kbps>150000 & operator == "T-Mobile NL"))
n.max.vf <- nrow(subset(df.4G, download_kbps>225000 & operator == "Vodafone NL"))
n.max.kpn <-nrow(subset(df.4G, download_kbps>225000 & operator == "KPN NL"))

# create filters 
rw.fltr.1 <- rownames(subset(df.4G, download_kbps>150000 & operator == "T-Mobile NL"))
rw.fltr.2 <- rownames(subset(df.4G, download_kbps>225000 & operator == "Vodafone NL"))
rw.fltr.3 <- rownames(subset(df.4G, download_kbps>225000 & operator == "KPN NL"))

# filter out these extremes
df.4G <- df.4G[setdiff(rownames(df.4G),rw.fltr.1),]
df.4G <- df.4G[setdiff(rownames(df.4G),rw.fltr.2),]
df.4G <- df.4G[setdiff(rownames(df.4G),rw.fltr.3),]

```

So we remove suspicious measurements in which the **download** speed exceeded the maximum theoretical speed per individual operator. 

For T-Mobile we removed `r n.max.tm` cases, for Vodafone we removed `r n.max.vf` cases and for KPN we removed `r n.max.kpn` cases.

After removing these suspicious measurements the dataset contains `r nrow(df.4G)` at this point.

Let's do the same for *upload speed*.

The maximum theoretical upload speed is for all operators the same: max 50Mbps.

```{r susp-upload-speed}
# create filters 
rw.fltr.4 <- rownames(subset(df.4G, upload_kbps>50000 & operator == "T-Mobile NL"))
rw.fltr.5 <-rownames(subset(df.4G, upload_kbps>50000 & operator == "Vodafone NL"))
rw.fltr.6 <-rownames(subset(df.4G, upload_kbps>50000 & operator == "KPN NL"))

# filter out these extremes
df.4G <- df.4G[setdiff(rownames(df.4G),rw.fltr.4),]
df.4G <- df.4G[setdiff(rownames(df.4G),rw.fltr.5),]
df.4G <- df.4G[setdiff(rownames(df.4G),rw.fltr.6),]

```

So again we remove suspicious measurements in which the **upload** speed exceeded the maximum theoretical speed per individual operator. For T-Mobile we removed `r length(rw.fltr.4)` cases, for Vodafone we removed `r length(rw.fltr.5)` cases and for KPN we removed `r length(rw.fltr.6)` cases.

After removing these suspicious measurements the dataset contains `r nrow(df.4G)` at this point.


### Suspicious coordinates

Are there any locations, or coordinates, that occur very often in the investigated area?
If we join the coordinates latitude and longitude together and look at the most frequent occurences we see that there are indeed some coordinates that are very frequent. How do these exact same coordinates end up in the data? To understand this we need to explain a bit more on how the Ookla Speedtest application gets the coordiantes from a mobile device. 
There are several scenario's that can be the case: 
1)The customer has approved the application access to the GPS coordinates of his/her device.
2)For some reason the app cannot read the GPS coordiantes from the device at the time of the test. This reason can be of different origins, the user has blocked access or we are in a building or there are other technical reasons why the exact GPS coordiantes cannot be accessed.

Whenever the exact coordinates are not available, due to measurement issues or because the customer is not allowing the application to use the GPS coordinates Ookla uses GEO-IP. GEO-IP is a online service to estimate the physical location of an ip-internet adress (more online [from maxmind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-services-and-databases) ).

```{r susp-coord}

# combine coordinates in "lat-lon" 
str.coord <- paste(df.4G$client_latitude,",",df.4G$client_longitude)

# top 10 most frequent locations
tbl <- head(sort(table(str.coord),decreasing = TRUE),n=15)
nms <- names(tbl)
df.tmp <- as.data.frame(cbind(nms,tbl))
names(df.tmp) <- c("Coordinates","Count")
kable(df.tmp, row.names = FALSE,align=c("l","r"))

coord <- names(sort(table(str.coord),decreasing = TRUE)[1])
n.test.at.coord <- sort(table(str.coord),decreasing = TRUE)[1]

```

To understand more on how GEO-IP works we asked some specific questions to Ookla on these issues.

Coordinate (52.5-5.75) : Response from ookla: *"The IP addresses associated with these tests show up as in the Netherlands, but that's specific as it gets regarding GEO-IP. Were assuming that 52.5, 5.75 is the Dutch equivalent of the middle of Kansas (in the US if GEO-IP Cannot be determined it defaults to the center of the US which in our case is Kansas). All it knows is it's in the Netherlands, so GeoIP specifies the center of the country."*

Coordinates (52.3667-4.9) and (52.35-4.9167) are both in Amsterdam, but in one case the latidude is with less precision and in the other the longitude. Question to Ookla: Can we still asume the measurements are from Amsterdam? 
Response Ookla: *Yes, GeoIP is used here. We can assume you are in Amsterdam but like any other GeoIP location result, the confidence level isn't as high as it would be if we were able to get location information directly from the device, meaning if we were able to obtain GPS instead of GEO-IP.* 

Coordinate (51.9167-4.5) is in Rotterdam. Again with limited precision, same respoonse as above from Ookla.

Coordinate (52.0666-4.3209) is in The Hague. All cases are tests with operator equal to "T-Mobile NL" also this location is close to the T-Mobile office in The Hague. We will exclude these tests as potentially being from T-Mobile employees.

Also see the [precision of the coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees) denotes the fact that we are unsure about the exact location.

**So what do we do with these suspicious coordinates?**
In the top location, which has coordinates (`r coord`) and is in the gemeente Dronten. We have `r n.test.at.coord` speedtests with this coordinate alone. We will analyse this set the same way we analyse individual Gemeentes.

```{r default-location}
# filter unkown location
df.unkwnloc <- df.4G[paste(df.4G$client_latitude,",",df.4G$client_longitude)==coord,]

# filter 52.0666-4.3209
coord <- "52.0666 , 4.3209"
df.dh <- df.4G[paste(df.4G$client_latitude,",",df.4G$client_longitude)==coord,]

# filter unkown location from 4G as we want only known locations
df.4G <- df.4G[setdiff(rownames(df.4G),rownames(df.dh)),]

# replace Dronten with UNKNOWN
df.unkwnloc$gm_naam <- "Unkown Location"

# filter unkown location from 4G as we want only known locations
df.4G <- df.4G[setdiff(rownames(df.4G),rownames(df.unkwnloc)),]

```

**T-Mobile head office**
We removed `r nrow(df.dh)` tests from coordinates "52.0666 , 4.3209" in The Hague. As they are close to the headoffice of T-Mobile and indeed all tests from this location are done from a T-Mobile network.

The other locations (to be precise all but these two: "52.5 , 5.75" and "52.0666 , 4.3209")  have been explained above and there is no knowledge at this point that leads to exclusion, so these tests reamin in the dataset.

After removing these suspicious measurements the dataset contains `r nrow(df.4G)` at this point.

### Suspicious dates or times
We count the number of tests per day for the months October, November and December. Again we are looking at  any suspicious peaks in the data?
```{r timestamps, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)

#Timeseries
counts <- table(df.4G$operator, df.4G$test_date)

# barplot(counts,
#   xlab="Dates", col=c("green","magenta","red"))
# legend("topright", 
#        legend = rownames(counts), 
#        fill = c("green","magenta","red"), 
#        cex = 0.5)

df.cnts <- as.data.frame(counts)
names(df.cnts) <- c("operator","date","freq")

# Faceting is a good alternative:
ggplot(df.cnts, aes(x=date,y=freq)) + geom_bar(width=.5,stat="identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ operator, nrow = 3) +

We know that on 6 October T-Mobile introduced new improved speeds for all customers on the "Stel Samen"" rateplans. This lead to increased number of tests. Also Vodafone allowed 2 days of free data usgaes for Chrismas(25/26 th of December). We find no disturbing or unknown peaks on a specific date. 

```{r}
# table
tbl <- addmargins(table(df.4G$operator, format(as.Date(df.4G$test_date, "%Y-%m-%d"), "%B")))
kable(tbl,caption="Counts per operator per month")

```

Above a count per month per operator.

### Ookla Speedtest itself
Ookla designed their speed test in such a way that the results are as robust as possible, so they deliver a reproducable speed metric. Please read more on the design decicions Ookla made to be able to deliver a robust and stable metric for speed test over http [here](https://support.speedtest.net/hc/en-us/articles/203845400-How-does-the-test-itself-work-How-is-the-result-calculated-).

Speedtest
=============
So we have analysed the data and looked for anomallies in the data, if found we have corrected them. Finally we are ready to compare speed test data between the three major telecom operators in Netherlands in the above defined coverage area. 

We  will analyse three different metrics:

* Download speed
* Upload speed
* Latency

There is no usefull way to aggregate these individual metrics into one overall ‘speed aggregated score’. Most customers are interested in download speeds, because it affects the most of their experience (browsing,streaming,downloading etc).  Most network speed comparisons only focus on download speed. However, since upload speed is also important for posting video’s and photos on social media, and ping times are important for gaming and fast opening of websites these metrics are also analyzed.

So how are the different metrics distributed?

Histogram distributions
----------------------
A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of data. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable (quantitative variable), [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) about histograms on wikipedia.

### Download speed

```{r downloadspeed, fig.cap='Histogram download speed per operator', fig.height=3, fig.pos='H' }
library(plyr)
cdf <- ddply(df.4G, "operator", summarise, download_kbps.mean=mean(download_kbps))

# With mean lines, using cdf from above
ggplot(df.4G, aes(x=download_kbps)) + geom_histogram( colour="black", fill="white") + 
    facet_grid(operator ~ .) +
    geom_vline(data=cdf, aes(xintercept=download_kbps.mean),
               linetype="solid", size=1, colour="red")

```


### Upload speed

```{r uploadspeed, fig.cap='Histogram upload speed per operator', fig.height=3 }
library(plyr)
cdf <- ddply(df.4G, "operator", summarise, upload_kbps.mean=mean(upload_kbps))

# With mean lines, using cdf from above
ggplot(df.4G, aes(x=upload_kbps)) + geom_histogram( colour="black", fill="white") + 
    facet_grid(operator ~ .) +
    geom_vline(data=cdf, aes(xintercept=upload_kbps.mean),
               linetype="solid", size=1, colour="red")

```

### Latency
For latency we take the log so the outliers scale and we can have a look at the shape of the distribution.

```{r latency, fig.cap='Histogram latency per operator', fig.height=3 }
library(plyr)
cdf <- ddply(df.4G, "operator", summarise, latency.mean=mean(log(latency)))

# With mean lines, using cdf from above
ggplot(df.4G, aes(x=log(latency))) + geom_histogram( colour="black", fill="white") + 
    facet_grid(operator ~ .) #+
#     geom_vline(data=cdf, aes(xintercept=log(latency.mean)),
#                linetype="dashed", size=1, colour="red")

```

Boxplot
---------
In descriptive statistics, a box plot or boxplot is a convenient way of graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. Box plots may also have lines extending vertically from the boxes (whiskers) indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles, hence the terms box-and-whisker plot and box-and-whisker diagram. Outliers may be plotted as individual points. [More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot) about boxplots on wikipedia.

### Download speed

```{r box-down, fig.cap='Boxplot download speed per operator'}
# boxplot
ggplot(df.4G, aes(x=operator, y=download_kbps, fill=operator)) + geom_boxplot() +
    guides(fill=FALSE) + stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point", shape=5, size=4)

```

### Upload speed

```{r box-up, fig.cap='Boxplot upload speed per operator'}
# boxplot
ggplot(df.4G, aes(x=operator, y=upload_kbps, fill=operator)) + geom_boxplot() +
    guides(fill=FALSE) + stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point", shape=5, size=4)

```

### Latency
For latency ( or ping) we take the log so the outliers scale and we can have a look at the shape of the distribution.
```{r box-latency, fig.cap='Boxplot latency speed per operator'}
# boxplot
ggplot(df.4G, aes(x=operator, y=log(latency), fill=operator)) + geom_boxplot() +
    guides(fill=FALSE) + stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point", shape=5, size=4)

```

Test design
-----------
What we want to test is if, on average, a customer that uses a specific operator gets a higher speed then using another operator, with all else equal. To do this we have collected thousands of test results from the three top operators. Now we want to compare each operator with the other two operators. So we do three test comparing each operator with one another. In each test we compare two sets of tests. These sets are also called samples (from the Dutch population of mobile phone users) from which we calculate the sample means. Now our statistical test, tests if these sample means are actually significantly different from one another.

In practice, the Central Limit Theorem assures us that, under a wide range of assumptions, the distributions of the two sample means being tested will themselves approach Normal distributions as the sample sizes get large, regardless (this is where the assumptions come in) of the distributions of the underlying data. As a consequence, as the sample size gets larger, the difference of the means becomes normally distributed, and the requirements necessary for the t-statistic of an unpaired t-test to have the nominal t distribution become satisfied (More on [significance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance) ).

Which statistical test do we need?
-----------
What we have here is a set of unpaired, independent, different samplesize, different variance data. So we need a [Welch t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t_test).

Significance
-----------
So when is a test sigificant? And if so at what level? And furthermore can we qualify such a significant result as good or bad? To start with the last remark, all qualifications of a statstical result are subjective. To explain this in more detail, let's consider the following scenario's. The first one: would you take a plane if the operator assures you that they have significantly proven they do not crash? Your next question will probably be, at what siginificance level did you take this conclusion? Their answer: With 95% confidence we can assure yu we will not crash. I guess you would not hop on right? So significance is alway relative, loosing your suitcase on a flight is not as bad as losing your life. One way of looking at 95% confidence is that 1 out of 20 trials (in 5% of the cases) you make a so called Type 1 error, in which you wrongly reject the null-hypothesis. So in this case, if the p-value would be 0.05 you would claim that operator x is faster then operator y while in fact they were not. In our test result we see that our p-values are very much smaller then 0.05, so changes of making this type of error are also considerably smaller then the claimed confidence. 

### P-value
In statistics, the p-value is a function of the observed sample results (a statistic) that is used for testing a statistical hypothesis. Before performing the test a threshold value is chosen, called the significance level of the test, traditionally 5% or 1% [1] and denoted as $\alpha$. If the p-value is equal or smaller than the significance level ($\alpha$), it suggests that the observed data is inconsistent with the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, and thus that hypothesis must be rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted as true ( see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value)).

```{r set-confidence-level}
conflevel <- 0.95
```

### Type I Error
The $\alpha$ or confidence level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is true (type I error) and is most often set at 0.05 (5%). 

Test results
===========
We test each operator agains the other two operators so we have three tests. We put the confidence level to `r 100*conflevel` %. Our null-hypothesis is that the means are drawn from the same sample, so they are not different.

Let see what our test results are:

```{r absolute-test-result, cache=FALSE}
# do test result use sourced function
df.tr.dwnload <- fn.ttest(df.4G,"download_kbps",conflevel)
df.tr.upload <- fn.ttest(df.4G,"upload_kbps",conflevel)
df.tr.latency <- fn.ttest(df.4G,"latency",conflevel)

# print test result 
kable(df.tr.dwnload,format = "pandoc" ,  caption = "Absolute comparison of means for metric: download(kbps)",align='c')
kable(df.tr.upload,format = "pandoc" ,  caption = "Absolute comparison of means for metric: upload(kbps)",align='c')
kable(df.tr.latency,format = "pandoc",  caption = "Absolute comparison of means for metric: latency",align='c')

```

Looking at the tables above we see that all results are significant and the P-values are very small. This means we can reject the null-hypothesis with great confidence. Hence we can state that the differences in the mean are significant.

Another way of looking at this result is that we can look at the lower bound of the confidence interval of the difference in the mean.
```{r relative conslusions}
# sometimes R is a bit cumbersome...
min.diff.tmvskpn <- as.numeric(as.character(df.tr.dwnload["T-Mobile vs KPN","Lower"]))
num.mean.kpn <- as.numeric(as.character(df.tr.dwnload["T-Mobile vs KPN","Mean 2"]))

min.diff.tmvsvf <- as.numeric(as.character(df.tr.dwnload["T-Mobile vs Vodafone","Lower"]))
num.mean.vf <- as.numeric(as.character(df.tr.dwnload["T-Mobile vs Vodafone","Mean 2"]))

```

So if one would like to make a relative statement about these testresults this could be done like the following:
With `r 100*conflevel`% certainty we can state that in the investigated area the 4G network of T-Mobile outperforms KPN by at least `r round(min.diff.tmvskpn/1000,2)`Mbps, which is at least `r round(100*(min.diff.tmvskpn/num.mean.kpn),1)`% faster.
Similarly we can say that with `r 100*conflevel`% certainty we can state that in the investigated area the 4G network of T-Mobile outperforms Vodafone by at least `r round(min.diff.tmvsvf/1000,2)`Mbps, which is `r round(100*(min.diff.tmvsvf/num.mean.vf),1)`% faster.

Similar statements can be derived from the result tables per individual gemeente below. Remark: Most, but not all tests at the Gemeente level are significant.

Conclusion
----------
This analysis has been conducted with the utmost care and to the best knowledge of the analyst. The analysis is opensource and all code can be downloaded, reviewed and repeated from [GitHub](https://github.com/hugokoopmans/ookla-speedtest-analysis).

Overall the tests performed give a significant result. Per gemeente some tests were not significant.

Top 20 Gemeentes 
=============
From CBS we have the following top 20 gemeentes based on number of inhabitants("aantal inwoners"). 


```{r gettop20}

# postgreSQL
require("RPostgreSQL", lib.loc="~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.0")

# Establish connection to PoststgreSQL using RPostgreSQL
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")

# Full version of connection setting
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname="4Gdb",host="localhost",port=5432,user="4Guser",password="4Gpassword" )

# all data joined on top 20 gemeentes
res <- dbSendQuery(con, "SELECT gm_code,gm_naam,aantal_inwoners from top20layer")

df.top20 <- fetch(res, n = -1)

# disconnect
dbDisconnect(con)

# print table
kable(df.top20)

# Add unknown as seperate "gemeente"
df.top20.plus.unknown <- rbind(df.top20, c("---","Unkown Location", nrow(df.unkwnloc)))

# add data of unknown to df
df.4G.plus.hotspots <- rbind(df.4G,df.unkwnloc)

```

In this test we use the CBS gemeentes in this area as the benchmark area for the overall comparison.

In more detailed analysis we investigate the top twenty "Gemeentes" based on number of inhabitants. based on data available at [CBS](http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/themas/dossiers/nederland-regionaal/publicaties/geografische-data/archief/2014/2013-wijk-en-buurtkaart-art.htm).

The coverage area of top 20 gemeentes looks like this.

```{r top20, echo=FALSE}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("./img/top20gemeentes.png")
 grid.raster(img)
```

From the CBS data we learn that the top 20 gemeentes covers 4855450 out of 16779185 inhabitants. Which is `r round(100*4855450/16779185,2)` %. in terms of area this is 2412 km^2 of a total of 41545 km^2, which is `r round(100*2412/41545,2)` %. 

For each gemeente we will do the significance test seperatly in the next pages.

```{r run-analysis-per-gemeente, comment='', echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
# run the analysis for each gemeente in the df.top20
out = NULL
for (i in  1:nrow(df.top20.plus.unknown)) {
#  out = c(out, knit_expand('analysis-per-gemeente.Rmd'))
  out = c(out, knit_child('analysis-per-gemeente.Rmd'))
}

cat(paste(out, collapse = '\n'))
#cat(knit(text=unlist(paste(out, collapse = '\n')), quiet=TRUE))

```
